# `Part::Primitive`

[Namespace index](index.md) | [Catalogue index](../index.md)

Category: DocumentObject descendant. Registration: `src/Mod/Part/App/PrimitiveFeature.cpp:68`. Abstract macro: yes.

Native parent: [Part::Feature](../Part/Feature.md). Read the parent record for inherited properties.

Python wrapper: unresolved direct binding association. An ancestor wrapper may be used or a handwritten getPyObject override may supply another; inspect implementation/runtime rather than invent a Python class.

[Wrapper association audit](wrapper-review.md).

Closest discovered ancestor binding: `Part::Feature` -> `Part.Feature`. This routes base API lookup; it does not establish this descendant's concrete returned wrapper.

Reviewed implementation context at `Part::Primitive`: Handwritten PrimitivePy derives from PartFeaturePy. No independent public Part.Primitive import is established by this review. Evidence: `src/Mod/Part/App/PrimitiveFeature.cpp:96`, `src/Mod/Part/App/PrimitiveFeature.cpp:104`, `src/Mod/Part/App/PrimitiveFeature.h`. Descendant getPyObject overrides and PythonObject replacement can change the returned value.
